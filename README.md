# BlackSharkWeb Backend

This repository contains the backend for the **BlackSharkWeb** application, built with Node.js and MySQL. It handles API requests, authentication, and database interactions for the BlackSharkWeb platform.

## Features

- User authentication (email-based).
- MySQL database integration.
- Secure environment variables for sensitive data.
- RESTful API architecture.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the backend locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IgnacioBarraza/BlackSharkWeb_Backend.git
   cd BlackSharkWeb_Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the `.env` file with the following keys:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3001

   MYSQLDATABASE=
   MYSQLHOST=
   MYSQLPASSWORD=
   MYSQLPORT=
   MYSQLUSER=
   MYSQL_DATABASE=

   SECRET=

   EMAIL=
   CLIENT_ID=
   CLIENT_SECRET=
   REFRESH_TOKEN=
   ```

   - Replace the placeholders with your actual values:
     - **MYSQL** variables for database connection.
     - **SECRET** for authentication token signing.
     - **EMAIL**, **CLIENT_ID**, **CLIENT_SECRET**, and **REFRESH_TOKEN** for email service configuration.

4. Start the MySQL server and ensure your database is accessible.

5. Run database migrations (if applicable).

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will run by default on `http://localhost:3001`. You can change the port in the `.env` file.

### Scripts

- **Start**: Starts the application in production mode.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
- **Development**: Starts the application in development mode with live reloading.
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

| Variable         | Description                           |

| `PORT`           | The port the server will run on       |
| `MYSQLDATABASE`   | Name of the MySQL database           |
| `MYSQLHOST`       | Host address of the MySQL database   |
| `MYSQLPASSWORD`   | Password for the MySQL user          |
| `MYSQLPORT`       | Port number for the MySQL database   |
| `MYSQLUSER`       | Username for the MySQL database      |
| `SECRET`          | Secret key for token authentication  |
| `EMAIL`           | Sender email address                |
| `CLIENT_ID`       | OAuth client ID for email service    |
| `CLIENT_SECRET`   | OAuth client secret for email service|
| `REFRESH_TOKEN`   | OAuth refresh token for email service|

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
| Method | Endpoint       | Description              |

## Debugging Tips

1. **Environment Variables**:
   Ensure all required variables in the `.env` file are set correctly.
   
2. **Database Connection**:
   If the application can't connect to the database:
   - Verify `MYSQLHOST`, `MYSQLPORT`, `MYSQLUSER`, `MYSQLPASSWORD`, and `MYSQLDATABASE` in `.env`.
   - Test the connection manually using a database client like MySQL Workbench or CLI tools.

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   If port `3001` is already in use, change the `PORT` in `.env` or stop the other application using the port.

4. **Logs**:
   Use the application logs for debugging. In development mode, detailed error logs are provided in the terminal.

<!-- ## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement robust unit and integration tests.
- [ ] Add rate limiting for security.
- [ ] Create detailed API documentation with Swagger.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment. -->
